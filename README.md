### Problem Statement:
Students travelling to and from college often struggle with high travel costs and limited public transport options. Trying to share rides using informal methods, such as WhatsApp groups, is messy-it leads to confusion, double bookings, sudden cancellations, and safety concerns because you cannot verify who you are traveling with. There is no proper system to check available rides in real time, prevent too many people from booking the same seat, or keep a history of past trips. This makes travel planning stressful, expensive, and inefficient for students.

### Current Solutions: 
Currently, most students rely on WhatsApp groups, college notice boards, or general taxi apps that aren't designed for student carpooling. These methods lack essential safety features, such as verifying that the passenger is actually a student from the same college. They also fail to handle crucial tasks, such as automatically removing old ride requests or strictly limiting the number of seats. While general apps work for solo rides, they don't support campus-specific routes or track shared college trips. As a result, existing solutions fail to offer a
safe, organised, and budget-friendly way for students to share rides.
